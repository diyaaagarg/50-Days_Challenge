PROBLEM 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
✅ Problem Statement:-
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

# Problem-> 287. Find the Duplicate Number

**Problem Link** : https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/

## 💡Approach
1.Create a frequency array freq of the same size as nums to count the number of times each value appears.
2.Traverse the input array:
->For each element, increment its count in the freq array.
->If any count exceeds 1, return that element as the duplicate.
3.If no duplicate is found, return 0 (fallback, though the problem guarantees a duplicate).

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity
TIME:O(n)
SPACE:O(n)->We use an extra frequency array of size n to store counts.
