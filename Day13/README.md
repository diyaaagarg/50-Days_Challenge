// PROBLEM 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
‚úÖ Problem Statement:-

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

**Problem Link**: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/description/

## üí°Approach
1.Create a dummy node pointing to the head of the list to handle edge cases smoothly.
2.Use a pointer prev that always tracks the last node in the result list.
3.Iterate through the list using head:
->If you find a sequence of duplicate values (i.e., head.val == head.next.val), keep skipping until values change.
->Once duplicates are skipped, link prev.next to head.next to remove the duplicate sequence.
->If no duplicates are found, move prev to the current node.
4.Return dummy.next as the new head of the modified list.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity
Time: O(n)->where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
Space: O(1)->constant space.

# Problem-> 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array

**Problem Link** : https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/description/

## üí°Approach
1.If an element is 0, the product is 0, so return 0 immediately.
2.Count the number of negative numbers:
->Every negative number flips the sign (sign *= -1).
3.You don‚Äôt need to compute the full product, just track the sign.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity
TIME:O(n).
SPACE:O(1).
